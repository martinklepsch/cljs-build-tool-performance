### What is this? 

Currently not much but it is intended as a bench mark project for ClojureScript build tools. Specifically Figwheel, shadow-cljs and boot-cljs.
The project is [based on status-react](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/) a relatively big but easy to get up-and-running ClojureScript.

### Running the various build tools

```
lein figwheel
```

```
boot run-android
```

shadow-cljs is still missing.
